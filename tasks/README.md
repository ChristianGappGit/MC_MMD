## Medical Tasks
For each medical task the .py source files are provided.
First the models are trained for the medical purposes. Secondly the models are analyzed regarding the performances (AUC for classification, c-index for regression). Finally the modality contribution metric is computed.
Altough the computation of the modality contribution is done in each folder (for each task),
we additionally provide the computation method in the Interpretability folder, 
together with some explanations.
